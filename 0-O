In the best case (when the input is already sorted), the time complexity is O(n) because the algorithm only needs to traverse the array once.
In the average case, the time complexity is O(n^2) because, in general, the algorithm needs to go through the array n times, and for each pass, it goes through the array again.
In the worst case (when the input is sorted in reverse order), the time complexity is still O(n^2) 2.
